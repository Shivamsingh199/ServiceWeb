     According to the timeless wisdom of vedas,Our dharmais a characterstics , not of OUR Body but of OUR 
     Soul, The spark of divine consciousness with in the heart of all living being. In short ,our Dharma,as eternally
     conscious selves,is to love and serve KRISHNA, THE SUPREM PERSONALITY OF GODHEAD. </li>
    <li>  In the material world our intrtpretation are full of illusion and takes away into deeper illusinary
      medium where we did not comeback to eternal form  because we are in polluted state.
    </li>
    <li>

        The root meaning of Dharma is that which sustains one's existence.</li>
       <li class="ajay"> Now if we realized our situation then we will get that we are all 
        only hankering for material self satisfaction while it is only for sudden of moment.
        as sometime when eat 50 <bold> GULABJAMUN</bold> Question should be ask with himself that howmany GULABJAMUN 
        can we eat and howalong can we eat then at that time we should think that
        if can we eat 100 GULABJAMUN consecutively 10 days in a day then u will not say anything but
         your favorite food will neccessary say as by giving a food poison..MEANS whatever we contains
          desires does not any role in human life, these desires are very big enemy of our eteranal conscious mind
        because these material desires deveiated our mind from our real goal to serve SUPREME LORD. </li>
        WHY we are suffering ?
        we are suffering because we became full of materilestic while we are spirit soul.
        Suffeieng is made for realization of commiting mistakes and Realizing ourself that 
        we are not a body we are spirit soul. 
    </li>
    <li>
        FROM SHRIMAD-BHAGAVATAM , These learnings are here,
        that really Dharma means rendering trancedental loving sevice to lord is the highest form of religion. 
    </li>
