        Reverantial Admiration & spontaneous affection for God
    </h1>
    <p> 
    In the material world-there is temporary relief from suffering. <br> Nowadays We are going in negative axis in the materail world.              
    <br> Positive axis is spritual world and as u know clearly this stage is a stable state.
    <br> Identification of material world that would be contemprary unreal thing not better than real so join with real
     and KRISHNA is the is real thing and first important than any other.
     Sense gratification should not be materelistic ,it should follow the vedic way of knowledge.
     <br> KRISHNA says in SB - "Mine devotee is so simple, we can put anywhere,they have no any desires 
     only they want to serve me" 
     <br> LORD KRISHNA is occean of humbleness as a example of MAHABHARATA , UTTARA prayes that "'O' LORD OF LORD 
     PLEASE SAVE MY CHILD" and then Lord KRISHNA protected te life of KING PARIKSHIT at the womb time.
     <br> For cleancing the heart ,We should follow the 64 regulative principles thought in NOD(Nector of devotion).
     <br>spontaneous devotion will come when we will take enjoy with daily practice.We should not waste our time use by practicing at any time.
     no matter of situations of places Only remebering the god matters.
     <br>Point is that follow the favorable which does not belong to material world.
     <br>Unfollow the unfavorable who belongs the material world.
